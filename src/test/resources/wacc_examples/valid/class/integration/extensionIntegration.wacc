# This test mainly tests for integration between imports, stdlib and classes
# Tests that we can extend from a class defined in an imported file
# Tests that we can call a stdlib frunction from a class method
# Tests that we a class will prefer to call its local method rather than outer scope functions in the event that their
# names are the same

# Output:
# "I am a parent method!"
# "super parent"
# "2"
# "hello"
# [1, 2, 3, 5, 7]
# 3

# Program:

begin
  include "stdlib.wacc"
  include "importFiles/classC.wacc"

    int[] callStdLib() is
      int[] arr = [3,1,5,7,2];
